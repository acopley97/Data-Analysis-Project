Data Analysis & Data Visualization code based on the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" code.  
This is Kaggle competition code, and I used it to predict the percentage of survivors based on class and sex.
After obtaining those percentages, I created a visualization of the data using bar graphs.
